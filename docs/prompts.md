# AI Prompts Used

- For this project, update CLAUDE.md such that it is always using SOLID principles, OOP principles, clean architecture with clear boundaries, DTOs and DAOs to reduce coupling. Let's also use Springboot and the latest version of Java with a Java H2 database. Is there anything else we should consider for best practices before we get started?

- Set up the barebones application according our specs, let's not focus on implementing anything just yet. We will do that next step by step together. Also, apply the YAGNI principle and add this to CLAUDE.md.
